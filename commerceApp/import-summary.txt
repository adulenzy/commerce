ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* pom.xml
* target/
* target/classes/
* target/classes/META-INF/
* target/classes/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
* target/classes/META-INF/maven/
* target/classes/META-INF/maven/com.github.kevinsawicki/
* target/classes/META-INF/maven/com.github.kevinsawicki/wishlist/
* target/classes/META-INF/maven/com.github.kevinsawicki/wishlist/pom.properties
* target/classes/META-INF/maven/com.github.kevinsawicki/wishlist/pom.xml
* target/test-classes/
* target/test-classes/com/
* target/test-classes/com/github/
* target/test-classes/com/github/kevinsawicki/
* target/test-classes/com/github/kevinsawicki/wishlist/
* target/test-classes/com/github/kevinsawicki/wishlist/ToasterTest.class
* target/test-classes/com/github/kevinsawicki/wishlist/ViewFinderTest$1.class
* target/test-classes/com/github/kevinsawicki/wishlist/ViewFinderTest$2.class
* target/test-classes/com/github/kevinsawicki/wishlist/ViewFinderTest$3.class
* target/test-classes/com/github/kevinsawicki/wishlist/ViewFinderTest.class
* target/test-classes/com/github/kevinsawicki/wishlist/ViewUtilsTest.class
* test-libs/
* test-libs/junit-4.10.jar
* test-libs/robolectric-1.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => wishlist/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* res/ => wishlist/src/main/res/
* src/main/java/ => wishlist/src/main/java/
* src/test/java/ => wishlist/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
